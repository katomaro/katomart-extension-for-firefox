# Helper Extension for Katomart
I never really made a browser extension like this one, so apologies for mistakens.  
PRs are welcome!

## Installation
- This extension will depend on you having Katomart running on at least your local machine (by default).
- After you got the aforementioned application running, simply clone this repo, and on Firefox go to about: about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
- Click on "Load Temporary Extension..."
- Navigate to the downloaded folder and select the file "Manifest.json"
- Go to you desired website afterwards and enjoy.

### Why?
Captchas lmao. ALso a cleaner implementation of a few things like selective DLs.
